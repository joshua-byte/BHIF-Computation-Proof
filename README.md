# Black Hole Information Force: Computational Analysis

Welcome to the **Black Hole Information Force** project — a computational physics repository designed to support the study presented in the paper *“Black Hole Information Force: Entropic Sinks in a Stretched Universe.”*

This project investigates a novel hypothesis that reconceptualizes black holes as dynamic, thermodynamic, and informational entities. Using gravitational wave strain data, the code calculates entropy flux, the so-called "information force," and other related physical quantities.

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains:

- **black_hole_info_force.py** — Core Python script for data processing and analysis
- **data/** — Folder to store gravitational wave strain data (HDF5 format)
- **results/** — Automatically generated results, plots, and logs
- **notebooks/** — (Optional) Jupyter notebooks for further exploratory analysis

The main objective is to provide numerical evidence for the **Black Hole Information Force** hypothesis through real-world gravitational data.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- Required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy h5py matplotlib scipy
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Download data**: Place gravitational wave strain data files (HDF5 format) in the `data/` directory.
2. **Run the analysis**:

```bash
python black_hole_info_force.py
```

3. **View results**: Outputs including plots, numerical logs, and graphs will be saved in the `results/` folder.
